### Milestone 2

* App layout coded (tabs, buttons, essential layout and navigation). All values are
hard-coded for now. At this point, the app will be easy for each member to create a fork
of, and individually develop their own features in their own time and environment.
* Have roles assigned for each member on which features of the app they are going to
develop

### Completed Tasks
We were able to complete all tasks for this milestone. General layout including dashboard was completed. Navigation is also set up. Workout values hard-coded. Everyone is continually working and developing their own features and the necessary features as well.

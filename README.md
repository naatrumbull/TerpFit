This project was developed over the course of a semester for the CMSC436 course (Mobile App Development for Android and IOS) at the University of Maryland. It was developed in a team of 5 using Flutter/Dart, and several flutter packages which can be found on pub.dev. See ``terfit\pubspec.yaml`` for the full list of packages used (also known as dependencies). The app utilizes location tracking, maps, calendar packages, and persistant storage.
